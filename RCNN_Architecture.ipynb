        "Ans:= Selective Search is a region proposal algorithm for object detection tasks. It starts by over-segmenting the image based on intensity of the pixels using a graph-based segmentation method by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher. Selective Search then takes these oversegments as initial input and performs the following steps."
