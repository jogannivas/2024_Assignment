        "Ans:= YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm that is faster and more accurate than many other CNN-based object detection algorithms. YOLO is also able to detect multiple objects in a single image, while many other CNN-based algorithms can only detect one object at a time."

YOLO v7 uses nine anchor boxes, which allows it to detect a wider range of object shapes and sizes compared to previous versions, thus helping to reduce the number of false positives."
