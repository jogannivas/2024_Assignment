        "\n",
        "Ans:= Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning techniques that group similar data points together based on certain criteria. There are various types of clustering algorithms, and they differ in their approach and underlying assumptions. Here are some of the main types:\n",

        "Approach: Builds a tree-like hierarchy of clusters by either starting with individual data points (agglomerative) or starting with a single cluster and iteratively splitting it (divisive).\n",
        "Assumptions: Assumes that data points closer in the hierarchy are more similar than those at a greater distance.\n",
        "Partitioning Clustering:\n",
        "\n",
        "Approach: Divides the data into distinct non-overlapping subsets or clusters.\n",

        "Assumptions: Assumes that data points in the same cluster are more similar than those in different clusters. K-Means, for instance, assumes spherical clusters.\n",
        "Density-Based Clustering:\n",

        "Approach: Identifies clusters based on the density of data points. It defines clusters as areas with higher data point density separated by areas of lower density.\n",

On re-computation of centroids, an instance can change the cluster. Tighter clusters are formed with K-means as compared to Hierarchical clustering."

For each k, calculate the total within-cluster sum of squares (WSS)."
